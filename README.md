# webpack-talk
Example code for the talk on Webpack

## The webpack scroll

- The app begins
- A `package.json`, `.gitignore`
- A `src` folder
- A `webpack.config.js`
- Adding `index.html`
- Adding support for `babel`
- Code splitting with `vendor` entry
- Still has issues since the `chunkhash` changes on every build
- Use the `manifest` chunk with `CommonsChunkPlugin`
- Add CSS support
- live reloading
